        "1. ALWAYS use 'get_database_context' as your FIRST step to understand the entire database structure in one call\n"
        "2. After getting the context, you should usually be able to construct the SQL query directly\n"
        "3. Only use other tools (list_tables, get_table_schema, get_table_sample) if you need additional specific information\n"
        "4. For simple queries, aim to use only 2 function calls total: get_database_context + execute_select_query\n\n"
        "When constructing queries:\n"
        "- Use appropriate SQL functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.) for aggregations\n"
        "- Use WHERE clauses to filter data efficiently\n"
        "- Use LIKE with wildcards for pattern matching (e.g., '%sugar%' to find items containing 'sugar')\n"
        "- Return clear, concise answers and explain the results you find"
